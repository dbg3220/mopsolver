## Mopsolver

Final Project for Mechanics of Programming

# Author: Damon Gonzalez

# Summary:
    The purpose of this project is to solve rectangular mazes given in
    text files using a breadth-first search algorithm. All implementation
    is done in C.

# Notes:
    The files print_help.h, print_help.c provide functions to the main module mopsolver
    for printing the standard usage message and pretty-printing mazes. The QueueADT files
    come directly from the implementation in homework 6 and are used in the BFS algorithm needed
    to find the shortest path of the puzzles.
